My app gives you a place to buy your favorite makeup products. Customers can enter a brand, type or price range to look up reviews before they buy and then can get redirected to the makeup product's website. The app features a way to look up product types and a way that they can get more specific if they want to search by brands too. There is an added search button and a dropdown feature and a price range feature. The app also features a way to purchase the product so the results all have a product link button that will take you the website.
